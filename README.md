# AmygdalaParcellationRQA
Code used to the amygdala parcellation on the basis of the signal dynamics quantified with the recurrence quantification analysis (rqa)


First part of the code is in the folder "RQAmatlab" and requires CRP Toolbox. by Marwan et al.,(2007): MARWAN, N.: Cross Recurrence Plot Toolbox for MATLAB®, Ver. 5.22 (R32.4), http://tocsy.pik-potsdam.de/CRPtoolbox/ and rqatoolbox by Richardson et al., (2013). The main function is performRQA

Second part of the code requires Anaconda Jupyter Notebook for Python 3.6 or higher.
